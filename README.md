A tower defense game halloween themed.

Game Story
----------

In the old days, every Oct 31th a little town gets attacked by monsters hungry for human flesh. Every citizen must protect his town until the end of that day, in order to survive.

Place citizens along the road that leads to the town. Each citizen has a special attack effect that deals more damage to one monster in particulary than others. The special attack effect goes like this:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Torch Thrower </td>
<td> Zomby </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Dogman </td>
<td> Skeleton </td>
</tr>
<tr>
