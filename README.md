Game Story
----------

In the old days, every Oct. 31th a little town gets attacked by monsters hungry for human flesh. Every citizen must protect his town until the end of that day, in order to survive.

Game Objective
--------------

Place citizens along the road that leads to the town. Each citizen has a special attack effect that deals more damage to one monster in particularly than others. The special attack effect goes like this:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Torch Thrower </td>
<td> Zomby </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Dogman </td>
<td> Mummy </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Monk </td>
<td> Vampire </td>
</tr>
</table>

Until the time runs out, try to defend the town from the monsters attack!
